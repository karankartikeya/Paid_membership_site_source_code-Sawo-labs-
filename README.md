# Source Code for the project : Paid Membership Site
# Build a paid membership site with Stripe and Sawo

**Stripe:** &nbsp;Online payment processing for internet businesses. Stripe is a suite of payment APIs that powers commerce for online businesses of all sizes.


# Requirements

- [Node.js 15.5+](https://nodejs.org/en/) or later
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported
- npm (comes bundled with node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)


# Steps


## 1. Generate SAWO API key

- Navigate to SAWO Dashboard or create a new account [here](https://dev.sawolabs.com/) and log in.

- In the SAWO dashboard, click on the create project button at the bottom left to create a new project.
  ![Project Button](img/create-new-project.png)

- Choose web and then code since we're working with react framework and will be writing the custom code ourselves.

![Select Web](img/web-os.png)

Click continue. You'll see a similar prompt like the one below.
![Create Project](img/naming-project.png)

- Name your project with a relevant name.
  2.1 For development in a local machine, the hostname should be set to 'localhost'.

  > If using "localhost" as hostname is not working for you, try "127.0.0.1"

  2.2 For production, the hostname should be set to your domain.

  > If you are adding your domain do not add 'https://', ''http://', 'www' or even trailing backslash. Example: https://dev.sawolabs.com/ should be kept as dev.sawolabs.com

On clicking the create button, we can successfully see the API key created prompt and SAWO keys csv file downloaded.

## 2. Generate Stripe API key and create a product with price

- Navigate to Stripe Dashboard or create a new account [here](https://stripe.com/) and log in.

- In the Stripe dashboard, click on the developers option.
![Developers](img/developers.png)

- In the developers section head to API keys, and there you can find the secret key and publishable key.

- Move to the products option to create your products with prices.
![Price](img/stripe.png)

- You will be able to see your price id in front of the price info after creating the product.

## 3. Install the dependencies

Enter the following command in the terminal to create a Next.js app.

```sh
npm i stripe, express
```


## 4. Make endpoints in index.js file and serve your HTML files

- Now, create an instance of express and path

  ```js
  const express = require("express");
  const app = express();
  const path = require("path");
  ```

- Serve the html files

  ```js
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));
  app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html");
  });
  app.get("/login", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/public/login.html");
  });
  app.get("/success", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/public/success.html");
  });
  app.listen("3000", console.log("Listening on port 3000."));
  ```

- Next, let's create an instance of stripe 
  ```js
  const stripe = require('stripe')('YOUR_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY');
  ```

- Import the price id generated above

  ```js
  const priceId = 'YOUR_PRICE_ID';
  ```

- Create a Checkout Session for Stripe

  ```js
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    billing_address_collection: 'auto',
    line_items: [
      {
        price: prices.data[0].id,
        // For metered billing, do not pass quantity
        quantity: 1,

      },
    ],
    mode: 'subscription',
    success_url: `${YOUR_DOMAIN}/success.html?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
    cancel_url: `${YOUR_DOMAIN}/cancel.html`,
  });

  res.redirect(303, session.url);
  });
  ```

- Get the price from lookup key

  ```js
  const prices = await stripe.prices.list({
    lookup_keys: [req.body.lookup_key],
    expand: ['data.product'],
  });
  ```

- Define the line items:

  ```js
  line_items: [
      {
        price: prices.data[0].id,
        // For metered billing, do not pass quantity
        quantity: 1,

      },
    ],
  ```

- Define the success and cancel urls:

  ```js
    success_url: `${YOUR_DOMAIN}/success.html?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
    cancel_url: `${YOUR_DOMAIN}/cancel.html`,
  ```

- Create a customer portal session:

  ```js
  const returnUrl = YOUR_DOMAIN;

  const portalSession = await stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({
    customer: checkoutSession.customer,
    return_url: returnUrl,
  });
  ```

- Provision access:

  ```js
  app.post(
  '/webhook',
  express.raw({ type: 'application/json' }),
  (request, response) => {
    const event = request.body;
    // Replace this endpoint secret with your endpoint's unique secret
    // If you are testing with the CLI, find the secret by running 'stripe listen'
    // If you are using an endpoint defined with the API or dashboard, look in your webhook settings
    // at https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
    const endpointSecret = 'whsec_12345';
    // Only verify the event if you have an endpoint secret defined.
    // Otherwise use the basic event deserialized with JSON.parse
    if (endpointSecret) {
      // Get the signature sent by Stripe
      const signature = request.headers['stripe-signature'];
      try {
        event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
          request.body,
          signature,
          endpointSecret
        );
      } catch (err) {
        console.log(`⚠️  Webhook signature verification failed.`, err.message);
        return response.sendStatus(400);
      }
    }
    let subscription;
    let status;
    // Handle the event
    switch (event.type) {
      case 'customer.subscription.trial_will_end':
        subscription = event.data.object;
        status = subscription.status;
        console.log(`Subscription status is ${status}.`);
        // Then define and call a method to handle the subscription trial ending.
        // handleSubscriptionTrialEnding(subscription);
        break;
      case 'customer.subscription.deleted':
        subscription = event.data.object;
        status = subscription.status;
        console.log(`Subscription status is ${status}.`);
        // Then define and call a method to handle the subscription deleted.
        // handleSubscriptionDeleted(subscriptionDeleted);
        break;
      case 'customer.subscription.created':
        subscription = event.data.object;
        status = subscription.status;
        console.log(`Subscription status is ${status}.`);
        // Then define and call a method to handle the subscription created.
        // handleSubscriptionCreated(subscription);
        break;
      case 'customer.subscription.updated':
        subscription = event.data.object;
        status = subscription.status;
        console.log(`Subscription status is ${status}.`);
        // Then define and call a method to handle the subscription update.
        // handleSubscriptionUpdated(subscription);
        break;
      default:
        // Unexpected event type
        console.log(`Unhandled event type ${event.type}.`);
    }
    // Return a 200 response to acknowledge receipt of the event
    response.send();
  }
  );
  ```
